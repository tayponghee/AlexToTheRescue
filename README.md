## Project Description
We built a robot "Alex" with search and rescue capabilities, applying baremetal coding concepts in our Arduino code as well

"Alex" has the following functions:  
- Tele-operated using VNC via WIFI
- Powered by RPi and Arduino Uno with UART communication
- Ability to map vicinity using LIDAR module
- Colour sensor to detect "identity" of detected victims in simulated test environment
